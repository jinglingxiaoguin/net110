Subject: [PATCH] BACKPORT: tcp_bbr: fix quantization code to not raise cwnd if
 not probing bandwidth

There was a bug in the previous logic that attempted to ensure gain cycling
gets inflight above BDP even for small BDPs. This code correctly raised and
lowered target inflight values during the gain cycle. And this code
correctly ensured that cwnd was raised when probing bandwidth. However, it
did not correspondingly ensure that cwnd was *not* raised in this way when
*not* probing for bandwidth. The result was that small-BDP flows that were
always cwnd-bound could go for many cycles with a fixed cwnd, and not probe
or yield bandwidth at all. This meant that multiple small-BDP flows could
fail to converge in their bandwidth allocations.
